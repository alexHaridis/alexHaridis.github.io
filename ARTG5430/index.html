            // Filetypes: 
            // txt, csv, json

            // PARSE FUNCTIONS

            // We can pre-process data in different file types by
            // providing a pre-processing function that we have defined
            // to D3 functions.

            // This generic parse function does nothing to the input and simply
            // prints its content using the console log method.
            function parseLOG(d) {
                console.log(d);

            // Reads a TXT file as a string and prints its content
            d3.text("datasets/file.txt", parseLOG);

            // Reads a CSV file in which values are comma-separated. Then, d3 converts
            // it into an array of objects. Headers in the CSV file are used as the
            // keys/names for the data objects. 
            // NOTE 1: First row of the file is expected to be the key names for each data point.
            // NOTE 2: All values associated with names have been converted into strings.
            //         You can perform conversions of data types as needed (more below).

            d3.csv("datasets/cities-sm.csv", parseLOG);

            // Reads a JSON file: JavaScript Object Notation.
            // The structure of this filetype is the same as JavaScript objects,
            // defined with pairs of keys/names and values.
            d3.json("datasets/countrycode-sm.json", parseLOG); 

            // Alternative way of defining a parse function for a d3 method.
            // This simply embeds the parse function within the d3.text method.
            // and the same holds for the other d3.<file type> methods.

            // NOTE: The previous approach, however, separates the parsing function from the method
            // that calls it and so it helps readability and reuseability of functions.
            d3.text("datasets/file.txt", function(data) {
                console.log(data);
