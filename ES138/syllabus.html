          <h2 class="index-heading" ><strong>Course Learning Objectives</strong></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop technical intuition and hands-on experience with computing paradigms in design including visual calculating with shape grammars, problem-solving, design knowledge and models of learning</li>
            <li>Differentiate and explain strengths, applicability, and weaknesses of major computing paradigms for thinking spatially about “objects in the world” as well as for addressing design problem-solving scenarios</li>
            <li>Integrate knowledge from design theory, art, mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence to foster a critical (evaluative) mindset on computing concepts</li>
            <li>Develop skills in constructive criticism of the design work done by peers incorporating verbal (in-person) and written critiques</li>
            <li>Build familiarity and a broad basis on past and present research and scholarship in design and computation to facilitate continuous learning</li>
            <li>Develop interest, knowledge, and skills that are necessary to undertake more advanced and specialized studies or research in the field</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="index-heading" ><strong>Course Format</strong></h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Lectures and Class Activities.</strong> Lectures introduce new concepts that are often exposed through short hands-on exercises in the classroom. Class activities involve hands-on experience with a particular technical method, readings analysis and discussion (including peer-critique), project reviews and student presentations.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading, Writing, Discussion.</strong> Students are expected to attend lecture weekly and to participate in the analysis and discussion of assigned readings (refer to the readings lists provided under course outline). There will be class sessions where students will be required to function as lecture leaders and to lead a discussion with external guests. Up to <strong>three planned class period absences</strong> are allowed without affecting one’s grade as long as they are registered in advance with me. <u>Remote attendance will be supported in exceptional situations.</u></li>
            <li><strong>Homework Assignments.</strong> There are four multi-step assignments, both individual and team based. The assignments involve handwritten technical exercises, reading comprehension and critical thinking, and short one or two-week projects. Late assignments will result in a reduction of one letter grade per day after the deadline unless extreme circumstances warrant an extension (must be arranged with instructor 24 hours before deadline).</li>
            <li><strong>Final Project.</strong> After about 2/3 of the semester, students will work individually or in teams of two on an original final project. Projects should focus on developing, implementing, extending, or applying one or more computational methods introduced in class to an original design case. Cases can be drawn from the built environment, everyday functional products, engineering design, technology and policy, and different areas of art. Various topic options that embody the themes of the course will be discussed, but students are also free to explore projects of their own interest. <strong>All projects will be documented and reported in the form of a final term paper with a mandatory in-class presentation (details will be provided in a separate project handout).</strong> See course outline for final presentation schedule and due date.</li>
            <li><strong>Presentations and Peer-Critique.</strong> Following the tradition of design studio education, students will be asked to participate in “crits” or reviews of their ongoing work (whether that’s for homework assignments or their final project). Assignments may ask students to give a presentation of their findings in class for peer feedback and critique. Peer feedback and ability to formulate constructive critique is an integral element of the course and part of the final grade.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Course Document.</strong> All students will submit a cumulative PDF document to Canvas that contains all of their homework assignments, written work, final project, or other material developed throughout the semester. A standard format for this cumulative PDF document will be provided. The purpose of the final course document is to provide students an opportunity to develop a complete “portfolio” of their work in the class for future use and reflection.</li>

          In this first module, we focus on things designed – the real-world artifacts of human design.
          How can we observe and understand design objects through verbal, visual, and spatial representations? What kinds of part-whole descriptions are possible, and for what purpose or meaning? Can the same design object have multiple meanings? We focus on “designed objects” in the broadest sense, to include cases from the built environment, everyday functional products, artworks, mechanical objects, material structures, and other.          <section style="margin-left: 25px;">

          <p>This module continues the exploration of representation and understanding, now with a focus on process and the concept of a visual algorithm. Visual algorithms are formalized through shape grammars and applications are explored both for style analysis and generative design. Related grammatical formalisms are discussed across design, engineering, and science. The module ends with a discussion on visual calculating as a framework for evaluating design objects as both art (aesthetics) and common use (utility). </p>

          <p>In this module, our exploration continues with more emphasis on computing using digital machines. This module is built around computational paradigms in design influenced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, traditionally distinguished between models of problem solving and models of learning. Of interest here is the issue of encoding/incorporating domain specific design knowledge (as in the rule-based methods covered in modules 1 and 2) in computational learning. The module includes a two-week session on Human-AI Interaction Evaluation, where students will test the effectiveness and usability of code produced by a vision language system. We end with a discussion and reflection on the two traditions of research in AI and some present critique.</p>
